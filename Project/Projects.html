    <p class="info">Earthâ€™s natural resources are not infinite and they cannot be replenished in a short
    period. The rapid increase in urbanization has used most of the resources like trees, minerals,
    fossil fuels, and water. Humans in their quest for a comfortable living have been using the
    resources of nature mindlessly. As a result, massive deforestation, resultant environmental
    pollution, wildlife destruction, and global warming are posing great threats to the survival of
    living beings.

    <p class="info">We should check deforestation and take up the planting of trees at a massive rate. It will not only
    save the animals from being extinct but also help create regular rainfall and preserve soil
    fertility. We should avoid over-dependence on fossil fuels like coal, petroleum products, and
    firewood which release harmful pollutants to the atmosphere. Non-conventional sources of energy like
    the sun, biogas and wind should be tapped to meet our growing need for energy. It will check and
    reduce global warming
